# Daily Habit Tracker

## Created by David V. Macisso

*Daily Habit Tracker* is a simple application that will help the user track and log their daily habits for achieving a desired outcome. It was designed with daily healthy habits in mind, but can be used for tracking any type of task for any period of time.

The application uses simple web technology, javascript, html, and css. The css file makes use of the Simple.css **Framework**, [https://simplecss.org/](https://simplecss.org/), that was slightly modified to suit the developers taste.
